### Key Decisions and Insights for Task 3 and Task 4

#### 1. **If the Entire Network Should Be Frozen**
   - **Key Decision**: I will freeze the entire network to leverage the pre-trained model's general features without any modifications.
   - **Insight**: This approach is ideal when the new task is very similar to the original task or when the dataset is small. For example, using a pre-trained VGG16 model for object detection on a dataset with similar objects ensures high accuracy without additional training.

#### 2. **If Only the Transformer Backbone Should Be Frozen**
   - **Key Decision**: I will freeze the transformer backbone to preserve its learned embeddings and fine-tune only the task-specific heads.
   - **Insight**: This is useful when the new task is related but not identical to the original task. For instance, using a transformer pre-trained on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) for sentiment classification allows the model to adapt to the new task while retaining its understanding of language structure.

#### 3. **If Only One of the Task-Specific Heads Should Be Frozen**
   - **Key Decision**: I will freeze one task-specific head (e.g., for Task A) while fine-tuning the other (e.g., for Task B).
   - **Insight**: This is beneficial in multi-task learning scenarios where one task is already well-represented by the pre-trained model, but the other requires adaptation. For example, freezing the Named Entity Recognition (NER) head while fine-tuning the sentiment classification head ensures stability in the trained task while adapting to new data.

### Transfer Learning Process

#### 1. **Choice of Pre-trained Model**
   - **Key Decision**: I will choose a pre-trained model based on the task similarity and dataset size.
   - **Insight**: For natural language understanding tasks, BERT is a strong choice due to its robust embeddings. For generative tasks, GPT is more suitable.

#### 2. **Layers to Freeze/Unfreeze**
   - **Key Decision**: I will Freeze the backbone for similar tasks and unfreeze deeper layers for significantly different tasks.
   - **Insight**:I will be freezing layers preserves general features and reduces computational costs, while unfreezing allows the model to adapt to new tasks.

#### 3. **Rationale Behind These Choices**
   - **Key Decision**: Balance between preserving pre-trained features and adapting to new tasks.
   - **Insight**: Freezing layers prevents overfitting and reduces training time, while unfreezing enables task-specific adaptation, especially for larger datasets or dissimilar tasks.
